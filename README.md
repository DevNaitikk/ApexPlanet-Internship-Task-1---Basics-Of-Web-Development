# ApexPlanet-Internship-Task-1---Basics-Of-Web-Development
This is my internship project made with html , css and javascript. It is a simple but functional webpage (obviously). If someone wants to see this project then you just have to copy the code and paste in the text editor whichever you use ( vs code suggested ) , download the preview extension , and click on go live . Thats It.
